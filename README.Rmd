The goal of logrx is to facilitate logging in a clinical environment with the goal of making code easily traceable and reproducible.

## Installation

This package is available from CRAN and can be installed by running: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("logrx")
```

To get the latest development version use:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("pharmaverse/logrx", ref = "dev")
```

## What is ```logrx``` ?

Simple!  The logrx package makes a log file for a R script!.  Below we have a short gif of
making a log file for a `adsl.R` script.  More details on the parts of the log script
are found in [Get Started](https://pharmaverse.github.io/logrx/articles/logrx.html) and we have several vignettes that show specific use cases for using the package.

```{r img-with-knitr, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='100%', fig.cap='logrx Addin in Action'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://pharmaverse.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/gifs/logrx.gif")
```

While many packages to facilitate the logging of code already exist in the R ecosystem, it is hard to find a solution that works well for clinical programming applications.  Many logging implementations are more implicit and rely on user input to create the log for the execution of a script.  While this is useful for logging specific events of an application, in clinical programming a log has a set purpose.  

```logrx``` is built around the concept of creating a log for the execution of an R script that provides an overview of what happened as well as the environment that it happened in.  We set out to create a flexible logging utility that could provide the necessary information to anyone reviewing the code execution so they can recreate the execution environment and run the code for themselves.  ```logrx``` is purpose-built for the needs of clinical programming to capture necessary elements of the environment and execution to be able to create a complete view of the program execution.

## Using logrx
```logrx``` can be used in a file or through scripting.  More information on how to use ```logrx``` can be found in [Get Started](https://pharmaverse.github.io/logrx/articles/logrx.html).
